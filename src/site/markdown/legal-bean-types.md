# Legal Bean Types

See https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CDI-502 for some interesting edge cases.

Note that the CDI specification never defines what an "actual type" is, but luckily in this closed bug report we have a
Weld author saying, "An actual type is a type that is not a wildcard nor an unresolved type variable."
